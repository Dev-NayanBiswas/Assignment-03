#### ***Features I tried to implement, in this Tailwind CSS project.***

1. *_I used **TailwindCSS CDN, TailwindCSS CLI, DaisyUI CDN, Font-Awesome CDN, Google-font**  here._*
2. _Though it was tough to be used to with sorter version of regular CSS, I found myself challenged to get to use DaisyUI here so without **"navbar"**, I avoid to use Use DaisyUI here._
3. _Tried to go through the Documentation of **TailwindCSS**, It was kinda challenging but I tried to follow **DRY** method._
4. **_tailwind.config.js_** _added just to get the suggestion of intellisense._
5. _to avoid Complexity and to keep HTML sheet cleaner, I used **Tailwind @layer component{ @apply}** to get the desired repetitive component styles._
6. _Here I used few Reusable components like - round-btn, round-icon, custom-width, light-btn, label-effect._
7. _To avoid dense repetitive class names, raw **Nested CSS** was used to get the placeholder animation based on sibling selection **peer** ._
8. _raw **CSS** on navbar menu options as well._
#### *For Bonus Mark*
10. _**Meet Our Team** part added for Bonus mark._
11. _In this **Meet Our Team** section, 3 breaking point **grid layout** design was used, as well as **aspect-ratio** used for square card shapes, **line-clamp** to manage paragraphs._
12. _Added cool hover feature on every card to make visible their designation and name._
13. _This project is Responsive on **large, medium** and ***small*** screen._
